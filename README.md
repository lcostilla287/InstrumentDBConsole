# InstrumentDBConsole
An *Empty Coffee Cups* Api Project
## The Project
This project is a console application program that goes along with the [Music Instrument Database](https://github.com/FredMacSWDev/MusicInstrumentDB).

In order for the program to function successfully, the user must clone the repository above and start the associated web api.
The user should also register a username and password through [Postman](https://www.postman.com) as the user will be required to use that login to access the database.

This program allows the user to login (provided that the user registered a login through the Postman application) and provide select one of the corresponding data sets:
1. Instrument Families
2. Instruments
3. Musicians

As the user accesses a particular data set, they will be prompted to choose one of the following:
1. Create
2. View all
3. View by Id
4. Update
5. Delete
6. Search by Name
